<h3 style="margin-top: 0;" id="overview">Overview of Features</h3>

<p>The Patrick theme is a very flexible theme, allowing you to create
something unique for your site. Highlights of some of the most notable
features:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Integration with <a href="http://pictaculous.com">Pictaculous</a> to
    create a unique color palette. Within <a
    href="<mt:CGIPath><mt:AdminScript>?__mode=theme_options&amp;blog_id=<mt:BlogID>#color_palette">Theme
    Options > Color Palette</a>, supply an image URL to the Source Image tab
    of the Pictaculous Palette field. Select an extracted palette then assign
    palette colors to named locations of the theme, creating a unique look for
    your blog.</li>

    <li>Further individualize your site with fonts from the <a
    href="http://www.google.com/webfonts">Google Web Fonts directory</a>. In
    <a
    href="<mt:CGIPath><mt:AdminScript>?__mode=theme_options&amp;blog_id=<mt:BlogID>#design">Theme
    Options > Design</a> you can select a different typeface (the font name),
    variation (regular, bold, italic, bold italic), and size for the body text
    and headings.</li>

    <li>A variety of design options to help individualize your blog: one, two,
    and three column layouts; control element transparency; Entry and Page
    meta display position; and home page carousel (with the jQuery <a
    href="http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/">Cycle</a> plugin).</li>

    <li>Facebook and Twitter integration. Facebook Commenting, Like button,
    and Recommendations social plugins along with Open Graph meta are
    included. The Twitter retweet button is also included.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="theme-options">Theme Options</h3>

<p>Each Theme Option field is <em>not</em> detailed here; the hint of the
field should (hopefully) offer adequate documentation of the feature. Some
features likely require a little extra explanation, and that's what you'll
find here.</p>

<h4 id="theme-options-callbacks">Callbacks</h4>

<p>&ldquo;Callback&rdquo; areas are provided for you to further customize
Patrick with any HTML or Javascript, for example. You'll find some callback
options in the Blog Callbacks tab, but there are also a few in other tabs:
Blog Header, Entry Formatting, and Page Formatting.</p>

<h4 id="theme-options-color-palette">Color Palette</h4>

<p>The Pictaculous Palette field returns eleven palettes from the image URL
you supply, found in the Choose Palette tab. Five are from <a
href="http://kuler.adobe.com">Adobe Kuler</a>, five are from <a
href="http://colourlovers.com">COLOURlovers</a>, and one is from <a
href="http://pictaculous.com">Pictaculous</a>. I don't have any idea how
Pictaculous determines what colors to extract from your image to create the
palette. Some of the results are beyond dubious (where all five colors in the
palette are the same, even). If you're not happy with the results, try
cropping the image differently or try a different image altogether.</p>

<p>The named locations in the Order Colors tab are likely only helpful if you
are already familiar with the HTML that makes up the page. The following
graphic should help clarify what named location corresponds to the area of the
page.</p>

<h1>[To do: create the image]</h1>

<p>When the same color is used in some adjacent named locations, spacing may
collapse and therefore disappear. For example, if the Widget Background and
Beta/Gamma Background are set to the same color, the spacing between them will
collapse to disappear, maintaining the expected amount of padding around the
element. This is a vague description, I know. Most can ignore this note
because the spacing will just work and look good, but if you're using some
custom CSS, this may be important to understand.</p>

<h4 id="theme-options-design">Design</h4>

<p>Setting a large radius in the Layout > Border Radius Theme Option (say,
larger than about 10) can have undesirable side effects: spacing around the
Facebook Recommendations plugin, for example, has a square overlap. Depending
upon the other options and widgets you use, you may want to avoid a large
radius (if you choose to use a radius at all).</p>

<h4 id="theme-options-home-page">Home Page Formatting</h4>

<p>The Entry Display Configuration section controls how entries are displayed
on the home page. Entries are displayed in the following order:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Featured entries: display with a large image as the background, as
    carousel that cycles through the most recent entries.</li>

    <li>Summarized entries: display in an "excerpt" format including the entry
    title (linked), meta, and excerpt text.</li>

    <li>Listed entries: display as a bulleted list of linked entry
    titles.</li>
</ol>

<p>The section Featured Entries Carousel Configuration allows you to configure
the Carousel, which uses the <a href="http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/">jQuery
Cycle plugin</a>. The variety of Display Effects and speeds directly configure
the plugin. I tried to create these options in a way that would require no
knowledge of jQuery or the Cycle plugin, however to understand all of the
effects you'll want to refer to the Cycle documentation.</p>

<h4 id="theme-options-facebook">Facebook</h4>

<p>There are a variety of features in the Patrick theme to integrate with
Facebook. In order to moderate comments and view analytics you'll need to
enter a Facebook Application ID. Creating a Facebook application is easy: <a
href="https://www.facebook.com/developers/createapp.php">just follow
Facebook's steps</a>.</p>

<p>The Facebook Like button width can be configured, and the height is
controlled by other options. Setting the width, in particular, is likely just
a matter of trial and error to make everything fit as you like.</p>

<h4 id="theme-options-twitter">Twitter</h4>

<p>The Twitter username is required for the Follow button, but optional for
use with the Retweet button.</p>


<h3 id="adding-widgets">Adding Additional Widgets</h3>

<p>Additional widgets can be created for use in the sidebars. In order to make
their formatting match other widgets, they will need to follow some basic
formatting provided by some simple HTML:</p>

<pre>&lt;div class="widget-archive-author widget-archive widget"&gt;
    &lt;h3 class="widget-header"&gt;Widget Title&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;div class="widget-content"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Any widget content goes here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

<p>The widget header line is optional; if you don't want to include a title
with your widget just exclude the following:</p>

<pre>&lt;h3 class="widget-header"&gt;Widget Title&lt;/h3&gt;</pre>

<p>Content should be added in the "widget-content" element, as you might
guess.</p>


<h3 id="custom-css">Custom CSS</h3>

<p>Want to make some style customizations to this theme? The best way to do
that is with the <a
href="https://github.com/endevver/mt-plugin-customcss/downloads">Custom
CSS</a> plugin. The Custom CSS plugin provides an editing interface to add
your own styles.</p>
